# JavaScript Challenge
The JavaScript challenge involved writing code to create a dynamic table based upon data provided, so as to allow users to filter the table data for specific values.


## UFO-level-1
   * An HTML web page with provided data listed as a table, with new rows of data added for each UFO sighting.
   * The date form is used to listen for events and search through the date/time column to filter and find rows that match user input.
   
## UFO-level-2
   * An HTML webpage that displays data in a table created using multiple input tags, so as to allow the user to set multiple filters while searching for UFO sightings.
